# **Section 6 - Shell scripting**

## **Lesson 106**
In all operating systems, there's a software called Kernel. This software keeps running in the background and forms an interface between the applications and the hardware (RAM, CPU etc..). 

Above the kernel, there is another component, called Shell, which is a set of commands that must be used to interact with the hardware. There is no other way to interact with the hardware other than through the Shell.
