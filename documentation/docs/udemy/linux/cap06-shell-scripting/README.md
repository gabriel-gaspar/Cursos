# **Section 6 - Shell scripting**

## **Lesson 106**
In all operating systems, there's a software called Kernel. This software keeps running in the background and forms an interface between the applications and the hardware (RAM, CPU etc..). The applications interact with the kernel through **System Calls**.

## **Lesson 107**
Above the kernel, there is another component, called Shell, which is an interface between the users and the Kernel. Therefore, the Shell is like a CLI that can be used by users to interact with the Kernel.

The GUI is a Shell. Why? because all user interactions with it are translated to Shell commands.

## **Lesson 108**
There are the following types of Shell:

- Gnome
    - It is a GUI
- KDE
    - It is another type of GUI
- sh
    - It is a type of command line interface (CLI) to run Shell commands
    - It was created along with the Linux system.
- bash
    - It is another type of CLI for Shell commands.
    - It stands for "born again shell"
    - It is like the "sh" but with a lot of new features.
