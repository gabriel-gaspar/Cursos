# **Section 6 - Shell scripting**

## **Lesson 106**
In all operating systems, there's a software called Kernel. This software keeps running in the background and forms an interface between the applications and the hardware (RAM, CPU etc..). The applications interact with the kernel through **System Calls**.

## **Lesson 107**
Above the kernel, there is another component, called Shell, which is an interface between the users and the Kernel. Therefore, the Shell is like a CLI that can be used by users to interact with the Kernel.

The GUI is a Shell. Why? because all user interactions with it are translated to Shell commands.
